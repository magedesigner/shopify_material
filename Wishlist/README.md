# SHOPIFY WISHLIST

A set of Shopify files used to implement a user wishlist on a Shopify store using (S)CSS, Javascript, and Liquid. This implementation uses javascript's localStorage to maintain a user's product wishlist and does not require a user to be logged in to a customer account.

NOTE: These files relay on jQuery being included in you theme.liduid before the close of **```</head>```**
```
{{ '//code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.3.min.js' | script_tag }}
```

## Features

* Let users add products to a wishlist that can be viewed on a custom wishlist page
* Users do not need to be logged into a customer account
* Show which products have already been added to the user's wishlist on any page where wishlist-buttons exist
* Have the wishlist page show a custom message if no items are currently in the user's wishlist
* Custom loading screen while the wishlist page populates

## Usage

To begin using the Shopify Wishlist copy the following files into your project directory:
* assets/Wishlist.js
* templates/page.wishlist.liquid
* snippets/product-tile.liquid
* snippets/wishlist-button.liquid

You must initalize the **Wishlist.js** module at the bottom of your *theme.liquid* file for it to work. For help, see the example in the **layout/theme.liquid** file provided.

```
<!-- Footer Scripts ================================ -->
{{ 'Wishlist.js' | asset_url | script_tag }}
<script>
  (function() {
    Wishlist.init();
  }());
</script>
```

### Wishlist Button

In order to add a product to a user's wishlist, there must be an element with a class of **wishlist-btn** and a data attribute **data-product-handle** that contains the handle of the product to be added. This can be found in the **wishlist-button.liquid** snippet file.

```
<div class="wishlist-btn" data-product-handle="{{ product.handle }}">Add To Wishlist</div>
```

On click, the wishlist-button element will have the class **is-active** added. The product handle from the element will be pushed to an array, converted to localStorage and saved. If a user clicks on a wishlist-button that is currently active, it will remove the corresponding product handle from the localStorage array, and remove the **is-active** class from that button.

```
<div class="wishlist-btn is-active" data-product-handle="{{ product.handle }}">Add To Wishlist</div>
```

### Mark Active Wishlist Items

Any time a page is loaded, the **Wishlist.js** file will scan the page for any wishlist-button elements that have a product handle matching those in the the localStorage array and automatically add the **is-active** class so that the user can see which products are already in their wishlist. 

```
var wishlist = localStorage.getItem('user_wishlist')
if (wishlist.indexOf(productHandle) > -1) {
  $(this).addClass('is-active');
}
```

### Wishlist Page 

To setup the custom wishlist page, create a new page called *wishlist* and set it's template to *page.wishlist* found in the **page.wishlist.liquid** file. Make sure the page handle is 'wishlist'. 

If you want to change the page handle make sure to update the function **loadWishlist** in **Wishlist.js**. 

On the custom wishlist page, we will initially load every product in the shop and then run a scan to filter out any products that are not part of the wishlist. 

```
var wishlist = localStorage.getItem('user_wishlist')
if (wishlist.indexOf(productHandle) === -1) {
  $(this).remove();
}
```

### Loading Screen

As some shop's may have many products, the **Wishlist.js** file will hide everything on the page except for a custom loading element until the scan is complete, at which point the loader will disappear and the wishlist items would populate.

```
displayOnlyWishlistItems();
$('.wishlist-loader').fadeOut(2000, function () {
  $('.wishlist-grid').addClass('is_visible');
  $('.wishlist-hero').addClass('is_visible');
});
```
